## Installation

In prompt run: "node index"

## Usage

Upon running the application the user is presented with a series of prompts regarding employee information. The user first inputs the information for the Manager, once complete, they then have the option to add either an Engineer, an Intern, or to exit. These options are given after each employee's data has been entered. When the user has entered all the employees, and they choose to exit, they will be presented with a completion message, that indicates the new HTML and CSS files are located in the "dist" folder. If they open the HTML file in their browser, they will be presented with the information they entered, displayed in a clear way.
